            Hello and welcome! As you probably guessed my name is Cody
            Eilar. I'm a New Mexico native who is into "X-mas", if you know what
            I mean. The land of enchantment will always have a special place in my
            heart, but I love to explore lands beyond the 505. My career and
             passions have taken me all over the United States, as well as the world!
            Software, engineering and science is where my career
            passions lie. I love solving complex problems for
            interesting business needs, fascinating research endeavors, and
            projects that improve the world around us. I'm an extravert and find
            working in teams very satisfying and fun. Laughing and hanging out
            with my co-workers is definitely towards the top of my list for
            after-work activities too!
            </p>
            <p>
            Work isn't everything that I am all about though! I love spending
            time with my lovely wife, skiing, running, cooking and relaxing with
            friends and family. I'm a laid back guy with a passion for "doing
            things right". I mean, if you are not going to have a good time
            "right", what's the point in doing it? My philosophy is do it up!
            </p>

              It had always been a dream of mine to create a tech startup, and
              this was finally my opportunity. As CTO and cofounder, my job
              requirements were broad. First and foremost, my goal was to
              architect and research the decentralized technology of the future.
              I consulted with experts in the field, wrote many experimental
              applications, and defined the technology that we would use in Lens
              to issue in an era in which users would control access to their
              own data, and interested parties would subscribe to it. Beyond
              that, it was also my responsibility to build a stellar tech team
              to helps us implement this bold vision. I hired talented engineers
              from across the world that had a passion for software development
              and helped create a product that had never existed before.
              Additionally, it was my mission and responsibilities to educate
              consumers and investors about how we are building the web of the
              future by giving talks and the University of New Mexico, tech
              clubs and at conferences. In this position, I not only got to
              write a great deal of exciting new code, but also polished my
              people and management skills. I've learned a great deal of lessons
              and in this position and have found invaluable insights in how to
              make a tech company run.
